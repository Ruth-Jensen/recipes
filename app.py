# Berry Filled Sweet Bread
# Yeast 2 1/4 tsp, Sugar 1 cup and 1 tbsp, Warm Water 2 cups, Salt 1 tsp, flour 5-6 cups and 2 tbsp, Frozen Berries 1-2 cups, Lemon Juice 1 tbsp, Cornstarch Slurry 1 tbsp, Cream Cheese 8oz, Whipped Cream 1/4 cup, Powdered Sugar 1-2 cup, 1 Egg
# Dough: Gently stir 2 1/4 tsp yeast, 1 tbsp sugar, and 1/4 cup of warm water in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and let it rise a little, approximately 10-15 minutes. Then add an additional 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 3/4 cup of warm water, and 1 tsp salt. Add in 5 cups of flour. Knead the dough while adding in up to 1 more cup of flour, just until the dough has the right consistency. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl somewhere warm. Cover with a dish towel and let rise for approximately 1 hour. - Berry Compote: Put 1-2 cups of frozen berries in a pot and 1/2 cup of sugar, more or less depending on the taste, 1 tbsp lemon juice, and 1 tbsp cornstarch. For this part of the recipe, you can adjust the amount of all the ingredients to your liking. Just remember, if you decide to add more cornstarch after the compote has heated up, you must add it in a slurry. Mix the cornstarch with a little water until the cornstarch is fully combined, then pour it into the compote. - Cream Cheese Filling: Microwave the cream cheese for about 30 seconds, or until it's soft. Add 1/4 cup whipped cream, 1-2 cups powdered sugar, just add poudered sugar until you like the taste, and finally add 1 tbsp flour. Stir until fully combined. - Combine and Bake: Once your dough has risen, preheat your oven to 350ï¿½F. Take the dough and roll it out on a floured surface. mentally divide the dough into three equal parts lengthwise. Cut the two outer sections into strips, going horizontally, such that the strips are still connected to the main part of the dough. Cover the middle portion of the dough with the cream cheese filling. Make a little well in the filling, going lengthwise. Fill the well with the berry compote. Take the strips on the sides of the dough, fold them over the top, and braid. place on a baking sheet, get a bowl and crack one egg in it and beat the egg, paint the top of the loaf with the egg, sprinkle with sugar, and bake for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown. - Serve: Once the bread is ready, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool down. Serve and enjoy!
